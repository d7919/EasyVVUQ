EasyVVUQ: Uncertainty intervals for everyone!
=============================================

EasyVVUQ is a Python library designed to facilitate verification, validation 
and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) for a wide variety of simulations.
It was conceived and developed within the EU funded `VECMA <http://www.vecma.eu/>`_ 
(Verified Exascale Computing for Multiscale Applications) project.

Goals
=====

The purpose of EasyVVUQ is to make it as easy as possible to implement 
advanced techniques for uncertainty quantification for existing 
application codes (or workflows).
We do not intend to re-invent the wheel, and plan on always building 
upon existing libraries such as
`Chaospy <https://chaospy.readthedocs.io/>`_ which focus on providing
statistical functionality.
Our aim is to expose these features in as accessible a way for users 
of scientific codes, in particular simulation software targeting HPC 
machines.
